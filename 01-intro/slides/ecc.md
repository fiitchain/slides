# Eliptic curve cryptography

Eliptic curve cryptography is a type of public key cryptography. It is based on the theory of elliptic curves over finite fields. It is used in many applications, including cryptocurrencies.

- most powerful but least understood types of cryptography in wide use today
- TL;DR is: ECC is the next generation of public key cryptography and, based on currently understood mathematics, provides a significantly more secure foundation than first generation public key cryptography systems like RSA
