- Involves organizing and categorizing the vast amount of data (transactions, blocks, and events).
- Data have flat structure, which can make it difficult to search or query specific data points.
- Creating a searchable database that maps key data points on the blockchain to their respective locations, making it easier to find and retrieve information.
- Extracting metadata from transactions and blocks, such as transaction amounts, sender and receiver addresses, and timestamp information.
- Indexers maintain an up-to-date index of the blockchain data.
<!-- Indexing is crucial for blockchain analytics, which involves analyzing and visualizing blockchain data to gain insights into network activity and behavior.
Indexing can also enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) that rely on fast, efficient access to blockchain data, such as decentralized exchanges and lending platforms. -->
