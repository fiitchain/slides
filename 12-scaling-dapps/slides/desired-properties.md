- **Do not sacrifice UX** - Reading data from the blockchain takes a lot of time and resources.

- **Analytics** - making data views is a great way to get insights into the data.

- **You can't process RMRK** - RMRK is basically string in the blockchain, so without indexers you can't process it.

- **Simple GraphQL interface** - a great way to get data from the blockchain.
