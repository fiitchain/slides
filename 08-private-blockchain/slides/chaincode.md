- Hyperledger  uses the terms ”Smart Contracts” and ”Chaincode”.
- Smart Contracts refer to  the transaction logic of an business object, 
- Chaincode is a technical container of a group of  related smart contracts for installation and instantiation.

- A chaincode program allows to write business logic that changes the state of the ledger.
