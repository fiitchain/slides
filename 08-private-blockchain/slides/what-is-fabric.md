- **Permissioned network:** Fabric is designed as platform to set up private and consortium Blockchain  networks. The framework uses a ‚ÄúMembership Service Provider‚Äù (MSP) to enroll new nodes into the  network.

- **Channels and multi-ledger**: A core feature of Fabric are so-called channels to establish connections  between peers. Each member of a channel maintains a copy of the channel‚Äôs specific ledger. Like in  other Blockchain networks, the ledger contains a sequenced list of all state transitions (transactions).

- **Chaincode**: Fabric allows network operators (system chaincode) and developers (application  chaincode) to define certain business logic for a whole channel or for particular transactions.
