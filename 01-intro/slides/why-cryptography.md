# Why is cryptography useful?

<!-- write why  -->
- **Secure communication** - ensure that only the right person can read the message

- **Data accessibility** - gain access to data if we have the right key 

- **Message authenticity** - prove that the message was sent by the right person

- **Data integrity** - physical signatures are easy to forge, digital signatures are not
