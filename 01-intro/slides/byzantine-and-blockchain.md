<p>


- blockchain network involves multiple nodes that must reach consensus on the state of the ledger, even in the presence of malicious actors who may attempt to disrupt the system

- the consensus mechanism is used to ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the state of the ledger

- Just as the generals must agree on a single course of action, the nodes in a blockchain network must agree on a single version of the ledger. If there are disagreements or inconsistencies, the network may be vulnerable to attacks or fraud
