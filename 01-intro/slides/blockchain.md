# Sooo what is blockchain? 

- A tamper-proof, shared digital append-only ledger that records
transactions grouped into blocks in a decentralized peer-to-
peer network.

- The permanent recording of transactions in the Blockchain
stores permanently the history of asset exchanges that take
place between the peers.

- Updating the ledger (usually) requires solving Byzantine
Agreements (hash) with economically incentivized participation,
secured by cryptography
