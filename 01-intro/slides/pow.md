- Mining is the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain.
- Miners compete with each other to find the correct nonce for a block and achieve the required hash.
- The miner who finds the correct hash first is rewarded with a coinbase transaction.
- Finding the correct hash requires a lot of energy, but cheating is not possible due to the one-way nature of the hash function.
- Other nodes in the network can easily verify the correctness of the hash by reading the block.
- If the hash is correct, the block is added to the blockchain and the miner is rewarded with a coinbase transaction.
