- decentralized protocol for sharing files on a peer-to-peer network.
- uses a distributed network of nodes to store and serve files, making it more resilient to censorship and data loss
- content-based addressing, which means that files are identified by their unique cryptographic hash, rather than their location on a specific server or network.
- protocol automatically retrieves the file from the node that has the closest copy, reducing latency and improving performance
- **When not accessed, file is garbage collected**
