- **Functions** - that expose certain data to the GraphQL schema.

- **Do not kill the user's device** - Parsing and processing data on the client-side is making the user's device slow.

- **Some queries are impossible to write** - Effectively, we can't write aggregation queries from GraphQL

- **Flexibility** - We can write queries that will return only the data we need.

- **No need for reindexing** - It's just a "server" extension.
