- Currently, applications are programs written in  NodeJS or Go or Java that use the Hyperledger Fabric  Client (HFC) SDK to invoke calls on a smart  contract.

- Applications are very similar to DApps in the  Ethereum ecosystem. They usually handle the UI  and enable an end user to use the Blockchain.

- Applications submit transactions to the network and  invoke chaincode calls.
